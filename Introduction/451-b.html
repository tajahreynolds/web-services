                <p>Chess.com is a website that I love a lot. It has a very simpled design and user interface that allows anyone to get into chess for free. Not only that, but they offer learning services such as analysis boards, chess puzzles, daily challenges, and even video lessons from professionals to help beginners learn this beautiful game!</p>

                <p>Without a doubt I can say I spend the most time on this next website. Twitch.tv is a platform where users can choose to watch livestreamers creating content, whether that be through interacting with the chat, creating art or music, playing video games, or even reacting to other content. With hundreds of thousands of live channels at any given time, Twitch is the place to go for content at the source.</p>

                <p>The final website I'd like to include on this page is Stocktwits.com. This website is a forum where you can see the latest news and opinions on everything to do with stocks. People are able to share whether they think the stock will go up, down, and why, and those comments get pulled into a feed of whatever stocks you want to keep up with!</p>
